Work-Time-Calculator
===================

A simple program that can calculate when you've finished your shift at work based on what time you starting working, how long your day is, and how long your breaks are. 

This is my first java program. I couldn't have done it without Rogers Cadenhead's excellent book _[Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours](http://workbench.cadenhead.org/book/java-7-24-hours/)_.
